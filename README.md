# formula-one

**formula-one** is a library which makes it easier to write type-safe forms with validations and complex inputs.

## A simple example

```jsx
type Person = {
  name: string,
  age: string,
  side: "Empire" | "Rebels",
};

const emptyPerson: Person = {
  name: "",
  age: null,
  side: "Empire",
};

<Form
  feedbackStrategy="Always"
  initialValue={emptyPerson}
  onSubmit={savePerson}
>
  {(link, onSubmit) => (
    <ObjectField link={link}>
      {links => (
        <>
          <Field link={links.name}>
            {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur) => (
              <>
                <label>Name:</label>
                <input type="text" onChange={onChange} onBlur={onBlur} />
              </>
            )}
          </Field>
          <Field link={links.age}>
            {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur) => (
              <>
                <label>Age:</label>
                <input type="text" onChange={onChange} onBlur={onBlur} />
              </>
            )}
          </Field>
          <Field link={links.side}>
            {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur) => (
              <>
                <label>Side:</label>
                <select onChange={onChange} onBlur={onBlur} value={value}>
                  <option value="Empire">Empire</option>
                  <option value="Rebels">Rebels</option>
                </select>
              </>
            )}
          </Field>
          <div>
            <button onClick={onSubmit}>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </>
      )}
    </ObjectField>
  )}
</Form>;
```

## Philosophy

**formula-one** helps you write forms in React by managing the state of your form and ensuring your inputs are the right type. It does this by introducing a new abstraction, called a _Field_. A _Field_ wraps some value and provides a way to render and edit that value. A simple _Field_ might wrap a `string`, which displays and edits its value through an `<input type="text">`. A more complex value, such as a date and time might be displayed as an ISO 8601 string and be edited through a calendar input.

*Field*s are specified using the `<Field>` component, which wraps your input using a render prop. It provides the value, errors, onChange, and onBlur handlers, which should be hooked up to your input.

Individual *Field*s are aggregated into objects and arrays using the `<ObjectField>` and `<ArrayField>` components. These components enable you to build forms with multiple fields.

In **formula-one**, all of the form's state is held in the `<Form>` component, and communicated to its internal *Field*s via opaque props called *link*s. These links contain all of the data and metadata used to render an input and its associated errors.

<!-- something about tree here? -->

## Validations

### Simple Validation

**formula-one** provides an api for specifying validations on *Field*s. Each _Field_ exposes a `validation` props, which has the type `T => Array<string>` for a `Field` of type `T`. Each string represents an error message, and the empty array indicates no errors.

An example of a `Field<string>` which doesn't allow empty strings:

```jsx
function noEmptyStrings(s: string): Array<string> {
  if (s === "") {
    return ["Cannot be empty"];
  }
}

<Field link={link} validation={noEmptyStrings}>
  {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur)} => (
  <>
    <input type="text" value={value} />
    <ul class="input_errors">
      {errors.map(error => (
        <li>{error}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </>
  )}
</Field>;
```

### When to show errors

In addition to tracking errors and validating when inputs change, **formula-one** tracks metadata to help you decide whether you should show errors to your user. `<Form>` allows you to specify a strategy for when to show errors.

The strategies currently supported are

| Strategy identifier        | Strategy Behavior                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always                     | Always show errors                                                              |
| OnFirstTouch               | Show errors for fields which have been touched (changed or blurred)             |
| OnFirstChange              | Show errors for fields which have been changed                                  |
| OnFirstSuccess             | Show errors for fields which have had their validations pass                    |
| OnFirstSuccessOrFirstTouch | Show errors for fields which have been changed or had their validations succeed |
| OnSubmit                   | Show errors after the form has been submitted                                   |

### Multiple validations for a single `<Field>`

To specify multiple validations for a single field, simply run the validations in sequence and serialize their errors into a single array.

```jsx
function validate(s: string): Array<string> {
  return [noShortStrings, mustHaveLettersAndNumbers, noLongStrings].flatMap(
    validation => validation(s)
  );
}
```

### Validations on aggregations of *Field*s

Both `<ObjectField>` and `<ArrayField>` allow a validation to be specified. You can use the `<ErrorHelper>` component to extract the errors from the link.

## Arrays in forms

Often, you may want to edit a list of items in a form. **formula-one** exposes an aggregator called `<ArrayField>`, which allows you to manipulate a list of *Field*s.

For example, imagine you have a form for a person, who has a name, but also some number of pets, who each have their own name.

```jsx
type Person = {
  name: string,
  pets: Array<{
    name: string,
  }>,
};

const emptyPerson = {
  name: "",
  pets: [],
};

<Form>
  {(link, onSubmit) => (
    <ObjectField link={link}>
      {links => (
        <>
          <Field link={links.name}>
            {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur) => (
              <>
                <label>Name:</label>
                <input type="text" onChange={onChange} onBlur={onBlur} />
              </>
            )}
          </Field>
          <ArrayField link={links.pets}>
            {(links, {addField}) => (
              <ul>
                {links.map((link, i) => (
                  <ObjectField link={link}>
                    {link => (
                      <Field link={link}>
                        {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur) => (
                          <li>
                            Pet #{i + 1}
                            <input
                              type="text"
                              value={value}
                              onChange={onChange}
                              onBlur={onBlur}
                            />
                          </li>
                        )}
                      </Field>
                    )}
                  </ObjectField>
                ))}
                {links.length === 0 ? "No pets :(" : null}
                <button onClick={addField(links.length, {name: ""})}>
                  Add pet
                </button>
              </ul>
            )}
          </ArrayField>
          <div>
            <button onClick={onSubmit}>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </>
      )}
    </ObjectField>
  )}
</Form>;
```

`<ArrayField>` exposes both an array of links to the array elements, but also an object containing mutators for the array:

- `addField(index: number, value: T)`: Add a field at a position in the array
- `removeField(index: number)`: Remove a field at a position in array
- `moveField(fromIndex: number, toIndex: number)`: Move a field in an array (preserves metadata for the field)

## Complex inputs

Even inputs which are complex can be wrapped in a `<Field>` wrapper, but validations are tracked at the field level, so you won't be able to use **formula-one** to track changes and validations below the field level.

<!-- ### Form state vs actual model -->

## Common use cases

### Form in a modal

Oftentimes, when you need to wrap a component which has a button you will use for submission, you can simply wrap that component with your `<Form>` element. The `<Form>` does not render any elements, so it will not affect your DOM hierarchy.

Example:

```jsx
<Form>
  {(link, handleSubmit) => (
    <Modal buttons={[<button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>]}>
      <MyField link={link} />
    </Modal>
  )}
</Form>
```

### External validation

Oftentimes, you will want to show errors from an external source (such as the server) in your form alongside any client-side validation errors. These can be passed into your `<Form>` component using the `serverErrors` (TODO(zach): change to `externalErrors`?) prop.

These errors must be in an object with keys representing the path to the field they should be associated with. For example, the errors:

```js
const serverErrors = {
  "/": "User failed to save!",
  "/email": "A user with this email already exists!",
};
```

could be used in this form:

```jsx
<Form serverErrors={serverErrors}>
  ({(link, handleSubmit)}) => (
  <>
    <ObjectField link={link}>
      {links => (
        <>
          <StringField link={links.name} />
          <StringField link={links.email} />
        </>
      )}
    </ObjectField>
    <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
  </>
  )}
</Form>
```

## Advanced usage

### Additional information in render prop

Additional information is available in an object which is the last argument to the `<Form>`, `<ObjectField>`, `<ArrayField>`, and `<Field>` components' render props. This object contains the following information:

| key                     | type                     | description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| touched                 | `boolean`                | Whether the field has been touched (blurred or changed)                                                                                                                                    |
| ch}anged                | `boolean`                | Whether the field has been changed                                                                                                                                                         |
| shouldShowErrors        | `boolean`                | Whether errors should be shown according to the current feedback strategy                                                                                                                  |
| unfilteredErrors        | `$ReadOnlyArray<string>` | All validation errors for the current field. (This differs from the `errors` argument in `<Field>`, since the `errors` argument in `<Field>` will be empty if `shouldShowErrors` is false) |
| valid                   | `boolean`                | Whether the field (and its children) pass their validations (NOTE: only client errors are considered!)                                                                                     |
| asyncValidationInFlight | `boolean`                | Whether there is an asynchronous validation in progress for this field                                                                                                                     |
| value                   | `T`                      | The current value for this field. (This will always match the `value` argument to `<Field>`)                                                                                               |

An example of how these data could be used:

```jsx
<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  ({(link, handleSubmit, {valid})}) => (
  <>
    <Field link={link}>
      {(value, errors, onChange, onBlur, {changed}) => (
        <label>
          Name
          <input
            type="text"
            value={value}
            onChange={onChange}
            onBlur={onBlur}
          />
          {changed ? "(Modified)" : null}
        </label>
      )}
    </Field>
    <button disabled={!valid} onClick={() => handleSubmit()}>
      Submit
    </button>
  </>
  )}
</Form>
```

### Multiple submission buttons

Sometimes, you need to have multiple submission buttons and need to know which button was clicked in your `onSubmit` prop callback. This can be achieved by passing additional information as an argument to the `handleSubmit` argument to your `<Form>`'s render prop. This argument will be passed to your `onSubmit` prop callback as a second argument. If your `onSubmit` prop callback is typed to make this extra data mandatory, they inner `handleSubmit` callback will require that data.

Example:

```jsx
function handleSubmit(value: User, saveOrSubmit: "save" | "submit") {
  if (saveOrSubmit === "save") {
    // ...
  } else if (saveOrSubmit === "submit") {
    // ...
  }
}

<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  ({(link, handleSubmit)}) => (
  <>
    <UserField link={link} />
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleSubmit("save")}>Save</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleSubmit("submit")}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  </>
  )}
</Form>;
```

### Submitting forms externally

It is easy to sumbit a **formula-one** form using the `handleSubmit` argument provided to `<Form>`'s render prop, but sometimes you need to submit a `<Form>` from outside. This is possible using the `submit()` method available on `<Form>` along with a React ref to that `<Form>` element. This `submit()` method can also receive additional user-specified information, as stated above.

```jsx
class MyExternalButtonExample extends React.Component<Props> {
  form: null | React.Element<typeof Form>;

  constructor(props: Props) {
    super(props);

    this.form = null;
    this.handleSubmitClick = this.handleSubmitClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleSubmitClick() {
    if (this.form != null) {
      this.form.submit();
    }
  }

  render() {
    <div>
      <Form
        ref={f => {
          this.form = f;
        }}
        onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      >
        ({(link, handleSubmit)}) => (<UserField link={link} />
        )}
      </Form>
      <button onClick={this.handleSubmitClick}>Submit</button>
    </div>;
  }
}
```
